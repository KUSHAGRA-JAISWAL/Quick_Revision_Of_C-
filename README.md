C++ is an object-oriented programming language designed by <b>Bjarne Stroustrup</b> which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs. C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.<br><br>
This repository is the collection of C++ Programs that has been done While Quickly revising C++.<br><br>

<h2><b>NOTE<b>:- All the Notes are Included inside the Programs. </h2>
<br>
This repo has divided into one main categories that covers:-<br>

⚫<u>Learning Sections</u>:- This section contains all the programs that will help you to understand all the Basic and some advance Concepts of C++. <br>

## ⭐Compilation <img src="https://i.imgur.com/bk962Bi.gif" height=30px>

 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/aLhRk4Z.gif" height=12px>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>( g++ program_name.cpp ):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> This will compile your program at the same location with the name a.out / a.exe .<br>

 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/aLhRk4Z.gif" height=12px>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>( g++ program_name.cpp -o xyz ):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> This will compile your program at the same place but if you use -0 it will give a custom name to your compiled program, in this case it is xyz. <br>

 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/aLhRk4Z.gif" height=12px>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>( g++ program_name.cpp -o ../../out/xyz ):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> This will compile your program at the location where you want to save with the name you want, in my case it is xyz.<br>

 ## ⭐Run<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZTeqcGO.gif" height=35px>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/aLhRk4Z.gif" height=12px>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>( program_name.exe ):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Writting this at the location where your program is compiled, it will run your C++ program.
